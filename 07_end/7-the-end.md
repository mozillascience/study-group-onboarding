#Whew! You did it!
Thank you for completeing the Study Group Lead Orientation, and congratulations!

We've got lots planned for the Study Group program-- more resources are coming your way, and we hope soon to begin to organize regional events, workshops, and meet-ups where different groups can get together. Please come to the Study Group calls to learn more. And please let us know how you're doing... say hello and give us an update about your group (successes and struggles both welcome) on the Gitter chat. 

Feel free to add an issue to this repo if you have comments, ideas, or feedback on this training series, and please jump in and help out with some of our [issues](https://github.com/mozillascience/study-group-onboarding/issues)-- we're always looking for help and contributions to improve these materials.
