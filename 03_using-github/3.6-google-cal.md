##3.6 Optional Assignment: Set up a Google Calendar for your Study Group
If you'd like to offer your community a calendar of events they can import into their own calendars, try using a Google Calendar. To set up, make a new google account, and update the variables in _config.yml under the heading 'Setup Google Calendar'.

You can add events to your calendar by hand, but if you'd like to manage it automatically, there's a script to do so in scripts/updateCalendar.py; instructions for use are at the top of that file.
