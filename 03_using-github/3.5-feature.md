##3.5 Assignment: Feature Your Community in the 'Who We Are' Section

Your website includes a gallery of participants in your Study Group; adding people here is a great way to show off your community and highlight your new friends and colleagues. To add someone to the list:

1. Edit the _data/members.yml file by adding the following section for them:  
    * name: their human name  
    * affiliation: school, lab, department, business....  
    * github: their GitHub handle  
    * interests (list one to three different interests)
2. Commit the file and your community members should appear in the gallery!
