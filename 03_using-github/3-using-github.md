Using GitHub

In addition to being a physical space for collaboration and learning, your Study Group will likely generate some content-- 
code, lessons, materials, as well as discussions, questions, announcements, planning documents, and more. For all these materials to be as useful and accessible to all your members as possible--- and to enable your members to contribute to them--they should live on the world wide web. We recommend using the web-based software platform called GitHub, which is designed for collaboration and version control. GitHub is a place to discuss changes and issues related to that content, and collaborate on creating more content together. Youâ€™ll store the collection of files related to your Study Group, called a repository, on GitHub. GitHub also is the software that will power your Study Group Website. While GitHub was developed by and for software engineers, you don't have to be an expert coder to use it. This section will take you through some of the basics.
